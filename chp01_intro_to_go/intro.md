# Go (Golang)

* Go was designed at Google.
* It was designed to have high performance, yet simple and easy to understand syntax.
* Go is statically typed, compiled language.
* Useful for running performant backend services.
* Great for networking and multiprocessing.

## Go Use Cases

* Cloud and networks services.
* Command Line Interfaces (CLI)
* Web development.
* Automation and DevOps.
* Utilities and stand-alone tools.

## Different Programming Languages
* There are various programming languages, each of which has its own use cases and language features.
* One of the main features of languages we concern ourselves with is static and dynamic typing.
* We also care about how languages are compiled and interpreted. 

## Interpreters and Compilers
* When we (human) write code, we write something known as **Source Code**.
* Before this code can be executed by our computer, it must first be **converted** into a language the machine can understand. 
* A **compiler** transforms our source code into something called **byte code**, that can be ran directly by the CPU.
* An **interpreter** transfroms and executes source code one line at a time.
* JavaScript is an interpreted language; Go is a compiled language.

##  Dynamic VS Static Typing
* Dynamic/Static typing refers to when and how the types of variables are decided.
* In dynamically typed languages variable types are decided at run-time, while in statically typed languages they are decided at compile time.
* JavaScript is dynamically typed; Go is statically typed.
